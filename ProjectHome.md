GeoXml is a term coined by google themselves referring to Geospatial XML formats and the Google Maps API has its own tool for handling it. This project is a third party parser which can take its place and opens up the features to include more GeoXml? formats and better OGC support... ie not just KML it also parses GML(such as produced by a WFS) and GeoRSS and GPX, its benefits include creation of collapsible tree based layer control (generally vertical in a sidebar). It can also save out to its own kjson format (requires json.js or a browser with built in json toJSONString support).

I have posted this to better enable others to help contribute and fix bugs and track versioning and bug fixes.. ok the latter might be the biggest reason, anyway I have decided to publish this in a more visible public fashion.
